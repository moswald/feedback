# moswald/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository.

It's a fork of [haacked/feedback](https://github.com/haacked/feedback), which is a blatant rip-off [holman/feedback](https://github.com/holman/feedback). But good ideas are meant to be spread.

I like to write about software, open source, .NET, and other random
topics at [moswald.github.io](http://moswald.github.io/). If you have a comment on a
specific blog post, please comment over there.

If you have any other questions about any of those topics or me, feel free to
ask it here.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/moswald/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@moswald](https://twitter.com/moswald) on
Twitter.
